                  <h2>History of Site</h2>
                  <div id="aboutTxt">
                     M'Ainmhi came from the realisation that there is no application on the market that is directly for tracking medical issues with your pet.
                     This sites creator has two pets and from the year 2019 has experience the pain it can be to keep track of a vets visit for your pet.
                     Especially when it comes to any issues they face where making a claim with their insurance company.
                     <br> <br>
                     What smart the idea came from our creators pet, hurt themselves that lead to their back legs needing ACL surgury that meant a cost for the surgury and stay
                     to medical and follow up trips to the vet. Our creator used a notes on their found to track dates and what happened on those dates. But had to keep emails in
                     certain locations to have the vet notes and images and a full report on the experience. Lucky they didnt have any long delays as their notes where correct and no issues
                     with the vets notes.
                     <br> <br>
                     This is not a break way at all to keep on top of issues this large and then complying it into one to give it to the insurance company. While hoping your notes and the vets
                     match or their is an issue of back and forth with emails and longer waiting time.
